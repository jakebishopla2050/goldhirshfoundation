# Our Vision

![](/assets/img/vision_lattice@x2.png)

We connect the dots between the best **emerging innovations** and the **financial**, **social**, and **human** capital to make them thrive.

We find **smart** people doing **creative** things, and we give them the **tools** to do them better.

## We exist for social innovators and are run by social innovators.

We **identify gaps** then support those on the first line of response. If holes remain, we **incubate solutions**.

Across it all, we **build networks** to ensure that the **strongest ideas** have the best support systems.

[SEE WHAT WEâ€™VE BEEN WORKING ON](/initiatives/)

* Enhance and broaden reach via communications

## 3. HUMAN CAPITAL
