title: '2,040 LAUSD Students Registered to Vote Ahead of Primary'

---

Through a #PartyatthePolls LA2050 Grant, the United Way dispersed $500 to schools for activities to encourage high school students to register and vote. The activities varied at each school and included rallies, DJs, cookies, posters and raspados. About 2,040 LA Unified students registered to vote at 28 schools, according to data from the United Way. About 60 percent of those students were eligible to vote in Tuesdayâ€™s primary; some were not yet 18 years old but could pre-register.
