A $1 million “basic income” experiment in Stockton has received an additional $250,000 contribution, Mayor Michael Tubbs’ office announced Thursday afternoon. The Goldhirsh Foundation announced it will match up to $250,000 in donations to Stockton’s recently revealed basic income program, which has been dubbed the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED).
