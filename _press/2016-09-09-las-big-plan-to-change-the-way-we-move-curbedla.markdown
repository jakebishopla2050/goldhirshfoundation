The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation have released Urban Mobility in the Digital Age, a new report that provides a roadmap for the city’s transportation future. The report is the first by a city in nation to reveal how it will make shared, self-driving vehicles a key part of its public transit future. The report was the product of an LADOT fellowship funded by the Goldhirsh Foundation, and addresses the city’s plan to combine self-driving vehicles with on-demand sharing services to create a suite of smarter, more efficient transit options.
