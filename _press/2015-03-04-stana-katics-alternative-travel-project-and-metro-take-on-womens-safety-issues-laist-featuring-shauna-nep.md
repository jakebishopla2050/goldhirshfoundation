The ATP and Metro-sponsored event focused on safety issues, upcoming Metro projects, and ways the public can get involved to improve the transportation system in Los Angeles. Shauna Nep, director of Community & Innovation at the Goldhirsh Foundation, talked about a “culture shift” away from home- and car-ownership for millennials and how more are opting for car-free lifestyles (as well as Uber and Lyft).
