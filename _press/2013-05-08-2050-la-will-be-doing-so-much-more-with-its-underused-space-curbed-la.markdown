The votes have been counted and KPCC has the list of 10 projects that are going to make Los Angeles super awesome in 2050. Well, hopefully. The projects are all winners in the LA2050 competition and get to split $1 million in prize money--the competition fielded 270 ideas that might make LA a better place in 37 years, and pledged to give $100,000 to the top vote-getter in each of eight categories, plus two additional wildcard projects chosen by the sponsoring Goldhirsh Foundation.
