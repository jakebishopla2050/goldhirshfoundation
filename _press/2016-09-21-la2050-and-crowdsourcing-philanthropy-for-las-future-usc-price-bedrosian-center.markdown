This episode of USC Bedrosian's LA#itself podcast features a conversation with Angie Jean-Marie, Social Innovation and Marketing Manager at the Goldhirsh Foundation, and her predecessor Shauna Nep, Senior Philanthropic Advisor at Fundamental. Jean-Marie and Nep discuss the origins for the the Goldhirsh Foundation's crowdsourcing approach for philanthropy, the inherent opportunities and challenges, and how LA2050's staff makes annual micro-adjustments to capitalize on Goldhirsh’s long-term funding agenda.
