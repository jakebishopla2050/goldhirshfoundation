“UCLA’s report card fills a gap in what we know about the county,” said Tara Roth, president of the Goldhirsh Foundation. “It gives the public and policymakers evidence of where improvement is needed, as well as a framework to talk about it. Our hope is that it leads to broader decision-making and policies to improve the county as a whole, not just one community at a time.”
