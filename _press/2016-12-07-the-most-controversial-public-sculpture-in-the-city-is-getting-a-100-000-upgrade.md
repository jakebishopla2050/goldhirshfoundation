Love it and/or hate it, the Triforium is finally going to live up to everything it was envisioned forâ€”as a gathering place, as an interactive public artwork, as a blazing rainbow beacon of downtown as a place of progress and vitality. The sculpture is getting a triumphal return to the tune of $100,000, won through the LA2050 grant competition. The money will be used to replace the mostly burnt-out bulbs behind the handmade Italian glass prisms with working LEDs, update the wiring and computer system that runs the thing, and develop an app people can use to compose music for the Triforium to play.
