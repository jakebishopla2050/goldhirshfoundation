Since 2012, when officials announced a plan to build 50 new, mostly small parks in some of L.A.â€™s most crowded neighborhoods, the city has completed 29. They are partnering with nonprofits like the L.A. Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land to build the parks and in some cases maintain them for several years before the city takes over.
