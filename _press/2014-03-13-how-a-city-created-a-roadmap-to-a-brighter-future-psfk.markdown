In 2013, the Goldhirsh Foundation launched LA2050, an initiative to create a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles, and to drive and track progress toward that vision. LA2050 looked at the health of the region through eight key indicators and made informed projections about where Los Angeles would be in the year 2050 if the city continued operate and the people continued to live as they are now.
