## How to make changes

The website is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the files are generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

As you make changes and commit/push them to GitHub, the [website](https://goldhirshfoundation.org) will automatically update.

For example, if you [edit the LA2050 page](https://github.com/la2050/goldhirshfoundation/edit/master/la2050.markdown) on GitHub, and then press the “Commit changes” button–you should see your changes on the [LA2050 page](https://goldhirshfoundation.org/la2050/) of the website within a few minutes.

## How to develop locally

If you want to see a preview of your changes while you work, you can [run a Jekyll server](https://jekyllrb.com) on your local machine. [Installing Ruby and Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is a good place to start.

After you have Jekyll installed, you can clone this project with [Git](https://git-scm.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)…

```
git clone https://github.com/la2050/goldhirshfoundation.git
```

And then start running the Jekyll application like this...

```
jekyll serve
```
