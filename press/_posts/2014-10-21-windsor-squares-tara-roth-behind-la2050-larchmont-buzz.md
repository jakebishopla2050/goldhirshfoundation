Suddenly this fall, it seemed the LA2050 Challenge was everywhere. We were sent emails and stopped on the street â€“ vote for a project that will better life in LA. Given one vote and so many potentially great projects, it was hard to understand where this was all coming from. Who was behind LA2050?
